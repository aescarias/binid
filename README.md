# BinID

BinID (Binary Identifier) is a tool for identifying and extracting the contents of a file.

BinID identifies files by matching patterns such as magic numbers and file headers. It also strives to provide metadata extracted from the file contents. BinID can be useful for determining an unknown file type, performing data recovery or digital forensics, and more.
